Everyone loves split-flap display! They rotate, the create that lovely noise!
Total win!

The way our crafted displays work is simple. Imagine that you have a list of
characters =AAA= and your goal is to get =ACE=. You rotate from the beginning.
So since the first letter is right, there is nothing to do. So it's =0=
rotations. Now in order to get from =A= to =C= we need to rotate =2= times.
Because it's =A - B - C=. So now we have =ACC= on the display. You can't rotate
only letter at specific position, you also rotate all the letters to the right.
So now, we have to get from =C= to =E=, which is again =2= rotations.

- =AAA=
- Rotate 0: =AAA=
- Rotate 2: =ACC=
- Rotate 2: =ACE=

If would want to convert =CAT= into =DOG=, it would require =1, 13, 27=
rotations.

** Scala

Your goal is to implement two functions:

- =flap(original: String, rotations: List[Int]): String= - which rotates
  original string using provided rotations.
- =calcRotations(original: String, target: String): List[Int]= - which
  calculates the list of rotations required to get from the =original= string to
  =target= string.

For your convenience there are tests. Make sure they pass!

- =TimetableSpec=
- =TimetableProp=

** JavaScript

Your goal is to implement two functions:

- =flap= that takes the =original= string, list of =rotations= to apply and
  returns the rotated string.
- =calcRotations= that takes the =original= string, =target= string and
  calculates the list of rotations required to get from the =original= string to
  =target= string.

Remember that =node test= is your friend!

** Haskell

Your goal is to implement two functions:

- =flap= of type =String -> [Int] -> String=, which rotates original string using
  provided rotations.
- =rotations= of type =String -> String -> [Int]=, which calculates the list of
  rotations required to get from the =original= string to =target= string.

Remember that =stack test= is your friend!
